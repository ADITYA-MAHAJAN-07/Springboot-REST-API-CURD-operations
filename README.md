# Spring Boot REST API - CRUD Operations

## Overview

This repository contains a robust backend application developed using Spring Boot and RESTful API principles. The primary focus is to demonstrate seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient data management.

## Codebase

Explore the actual codebase in the [restapp/src/main/java/com/restful/restapp](https://github.com/ADITYA-MAHAJAN-07/Springboot-REST-API-CURD-operations/tree/9a8ac5a89f127302dfe3ecd0a5f530a5d92e016d/restapp/src/main/java/com/restful/restapp) directory. The Java source code is organized by packages, providing insights into the implementation details.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot Framework:** Leverages the power of Spring Boot for simplified development.
  
- **RESTful API:** Follows RESTful principles, providing a scalable and interoperable interface.

- **CRUD Operations:** Facilitates Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through well-defined endpoints.

- **Data Persistence:** Integrated with a data store, ensuring durability and reliability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure application properties for your database settings.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Access the API through provided endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- RESTful API
# Challenges I faced  
## Microservices Architecture:

   - Description: Imagine building an application like LEGO blocks, where each block (microservice) does a specific job. Making sure these blocks can find each other, talk to each other, and handle data together is the challenge.
    - Solution: Learn how to organize and connect these blocks (services) using tools like Spring Cloud. Understand how to balance the load, manage configurations, and keep an eye on each block's health.

## Spring Security with OAuth2:

   - Description: Think of your app as a high-security vault. OAuth2 is like a complex lock system. Setting it up means deciding who gets the keys (access tokens) to enter different parts of the vault based on their roles.
   - Solution: Learn to configure this lock system (OAuth2) to control who gets in, manage different access levels, and secure communication between your app and other trusted places.

## Spring Data JPA with Complex Queries:

   - Description: Imagine you have a giant library of books (database), and you want to find specific books using a magic language (JPQL). Creating efficient ways to find and organize these books, considering how they relate to each other, is the challenge.
   - Solution: Learn how to speak this magic language (JPQL) to ask the library for specific books. Also, understand how to create efficient shelves (entities and associations) and manage the library's inventory (transactions) smoothly.
